We gonna Learn about Virtual DOM, Fibre, Reconciliation in React.js

in Virtual DOM we track the the DOM in Tree like Structure so the changed value get replace only and remaining will same

every ui donot need to update simultaneously but it will refer to apply some algorithm to wait for the final request and
only work/respond for the final rrequest 
means only update the ui on the final request and donot response to the intermediate requests
so it will help to build good application for specific rules

so we want to learn React Fiber
React uses fiber algorithm to update the Virtual DOM or Ui behind the scene

Reconciliation is a react algorithm which reconsider in recurrsive way to whom will update
it will update only the changes
Reconciliation is th algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "Virtual DOM"

Although Fiber is a ground-up rewrite of the reconciler, the high-level algorithm described 
in the React docs will be largely the same. The key points are:

-> Different component types are assumed to generate substantially different trees. 
   React will not attempt to diff them, but rather replace the old tree completely.
-> Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."
