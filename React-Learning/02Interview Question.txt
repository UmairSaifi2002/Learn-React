  Now we gonna Learn an interview Question which is asked in React interview

  so Question is -> in given function
  let [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)

  let addValue = () => {
    setCounter(counter +1)
    setCounter(counter +1)
    setCounter(counter +1)
    setCounter(counter +1)
  }
	tell me that what is the value of the counter when the user click the button to add the value
	is it +4 or not

	Answer -> Due to Fiber Concept React take it as the batch process so it only add the value by +1
		  
	Counter Question by interviewer -> so what is the processor to add the value like the function shows
	Answer -> so we know that 'setCounter returns the function to add the value'
		  so if we use arrow function to add the value so it add the values as much times you want in this manner

let [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)

  let addValue = () => {
    setCounter(counter => counter +1)
    setCounter(counter => counter +1)
    setCounter(counter => counter +1)
    setCounter(counter => counter +1)
  }
